This is my second blog post, This is published at the same time as my first blog post so you dont actually know for certain which came first. This is extremely long and shit, infact this specific blog post is only long becaused I wanted to pad the post enough to see what would happen with the preview on the homepage. Will it show the full length of this post? or will it perhaps show me a snippet of whats to come... Find out, now!
